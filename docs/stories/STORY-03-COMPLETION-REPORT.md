**Story ID:** PGC-003
**Completed Date:** 2025-10-08
**Developer:** Dev Agent (James)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (Core Implementation)

## Summary

Successfully implemented the Instructor Commission Service and Withdrawal Service for tracking instructor earnings and managing withdrawal requests. The system now automatically creates commission records for transactions processed through centralized gateways and provides comprehensive withdrawal management capabilities.

---

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. InstructorCommissionService

✅ **`app/Services/InstructorCommissionService.php`** (299 lines)

**Methods Implemented:**
- `createCommissionRecord(Transaction $transaction): InstructorCommission` - Create commission from transaction
- `calculateNetEarnings(int $environmentId): float` - Calculate available balance
- `getTotalEarned(int $environmentId): float` - Total all-time earnings
- `getTotalPaid(int $environmentId): float` - Total paid out
- `getAvailableBalance(int $environmentId): float` - Available for withdrawal
- `getCommissions(int $environmentId, array $filters): Collection` - Filtered commission list
- `approveCommission(InstructorCommission $commission): bool` - Approve single commission
- `bulkApproveCommissions(array $commissionIds): array` - Bulk approve multiple commissions
- `markAsPaid(InstructorCommission $commission, string $paymentReference): bool` - Mark as paid

**Key Features:**
- Automatic commission calculation based on config rates
- DB transactions for data integrity
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Supports filtering by status, date range, withdrawal status

### 2. WithdrawalService

✅ **`app/Services/WithdrawalService.php`** (291 lines)

**Methods Implemented:**
- `createWithdrawalRequest(int $environmentId, int $userId, float $amount, array $details): WithdrawalRequest` - Create request
- `approveWithdrawal(WithdrawalRequest $request, int $approvedBy): bool` - Approve request
- `rejectWithdrawal(WithdrawalRequest $request, string $reason): bool` - Reject and unlink commissions
- `processWithdrawal(WithdrawalRequest $request, int $processedBy, string $reference): bool` - Mark as completed and paid
- `getAvailableBalance(int $environmentId): float` - Get balance for withdrawal
- `validateWithdrawalAmount(int $environmentId, float $amount): bool` - Validate against minimum and balance
- `getWithdrawalRequests(int $environmentId, array $filters)` - Filtered withdrawal list

**Key Features:**
- Automatic commission linking to withdrawals
- Validates minimum withdrawal amounts
- Validates against available balance
- Tracks approval/processing workflow
- Unlinks commissions on rejection
- Marks commissions as paid on completion

### 3. TransactionController Update

✅ **Modified `app/Http/Controllers/Api/TransactionController.php`**

**Added Commission Creation Logic** (lines 1719-1739):
```php
// NEW: Create commission record for centralized payments
try {
    $environmentPaymentConfigService = app(\App\Services\EnvironmentPaymentConfigService::class);
    $instructorCommissionService = app(\App\Services\InstructorCommissionService::class);

    $config = $environmentPaymentConfigService->getConfig($transaction->environment_id);

    if ($config && $config->use_centralized_gateways) {
        $instructorCommissionService->createCommissionRecord($transaction);
        Log::info('Commission record created for centralized payment');
    }
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    Log::error('Failed to create commission record');
    // Don't fail the transaction if commission creation fails
}
```

**Location:** After transaction is marked as completed (Monetbill webhook handler)

**Behavior:**
- Only creates commissions for environments using centralized gateways
- Non-blocking (transaction succeeds even if commission creation fails)
- Comprehensive error logging
- Uses service locator pattern for dependency resolution

## Technical Implementation Details

### Commission Creation Flow

```
Transaction Completed (via webhook)
    ↓
Transaction status = 'completed'
    ↓
Check: Environment uses centralized gateways?
    ↓
[YES] → Create InstructorCommission record
    ↓
Calculate amounts:
    - gross_amount = transaction.total_amount
    - commission_rate = config.commission_rate (17%)
    - commission_amount = gross * rate
    - net_amount = gross - commission
    ↓
Save commission (status: 'pending')
    ↓
Log success
```

### Withdrawal Request Flow

```
Instructor requests withdrawal
    ↓
Validate amount (>= minimum, <= available)
    ↓
Find approved commissions (not yet withdrawn)
    ↓
Select commissions up to requested amount
    ↓
Create WithdrawalRequest
    ↓
Link commissions to withdrawal
    ↓
Status: 'pending' → awaits admin approval
```

### Withdrawal Approval Flow

```
Admin approves withdrawal
    ↓
Status: 'approved'
    ↓
Admin processes payment (external)
    ↓
Admin marks as processed
    ↓
Status: 'completed'
    ↓
Linked commissions marked as 'paid'
    ↓
Instructors receive payment
```

## Commission Calculation Example

**Scenario:** Environment 2 uses centralized gateways, commission rate = 17%

```
Transaction Amount: 100,000 XAF
Commission Rate: 0.17 (17%)
Commission Amount: 17,000 XAF (platform takes)
Net Amount: 83,000 XAF (instructor receives)

InstructorCommission record:
- gross_amount: 100,000.00
- commission_rate: 0.1700
- commission_amount: 17,000.00
- net_amount: 83,000.00
- status: 'pending' (awaits approval)
```

---

## Withdrawal Validation Example

**Scenario:** Instructor has 250,000 XAF available, minimum = 50,000 XAF

```
Valid Requests:
✅ 50,000 XAF (exactly minimum)
✅ 100,000 XAF (within balance)
✅ 250,000 XAF (full balance)

Invalid Requests:
❌ 49,999 XAF (below minimum)
❌ 250,001 XAF (exceeds balance)
❌ -10,000 XAF (negative amount)
```

## Database Integration

### Commission Record Example
```sql
INSERT INTO instructor_commissions (
    environment_id, transaction_id, order_id,
    gross_amount, commission_rate, commission_amount, net_amount,
    currency, status
) VALUES (
    2, 123, 456,
    100000.00, 0.1700, 17000.00, 83000.00,
    'XAF', 'pending'
);
```

### Withdrawal Request Example
```sql
INSERT INTO withdrawal_requests (
    environment_id, requested_by, amount, currency,
    status, withdrawal_method, withdrawal_details, commission_ids
) VALUES (
    2, 789, 250000.00, 'XAF',
    'pending', 'bank_transfer',
    '{"method":"bank_transfer","bank_name":"Test Bank","account_number":"123"}',
    '[1,2,3,4,5]'
);
```
