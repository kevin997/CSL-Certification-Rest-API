# Story 2: Environment Payment Config Service & Centralized Gateway Routing - Brownfield Addition

**Story ID:** PGC-002
**Epic:** Payment Gateway Centralization (EPIC-PGC-001)
**Created:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** Completed
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 1 Week
**Sprint:** Sprint 2
**Depends On:** Story 1 (PGC-001)
**Completed:** 2025-10-08

## User Story

As a **system administrator**,
I want environments to optionally route payment transactions through Environment 1's gateways,
So that we can centralize payment processing for environments that opt-in while maintaining backward compatibility for others.

---

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration

**Integrates with:**
- `PaymentService` (`app/Services/PaymentService.php`) - Existing payment processing service
- `PaymentGatewaySetting` model - Existing gateway configuration
- `EnvironmentPaymentConfig` model (NEW from Story 1)
- `Transaction` model - Existing transaction records

**Technology:**
- Laravel 10 services
- Existing gateway factory pattern (Stripe, MonetBill, Lygos, PayPal)
- Existing commission calculation via `CommissionService`

**Follows pattern:**
- Service layer pattern (business logic in services, not controllers)
- Dependency injection via constructor
- Repository pattern for complex queries
- Existing `initializeGateway()` method pattern

**Touch points:**
- Modify `PaymentService::initializeGateway()` with conditional routing logic
- Create new `EnvironmentPaymentConfigService`
- Integrate with existing gateway factory pattern

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Create EnvironmentPaymentConfigService**
- Service file: `app/Services/EnvironmentPaymentConfigService.php`
- Methods required:
  ```php
  // Get payment config for environment (with caching)
  public function getConfig(int $environmentId): ?EnvironmentPaymentConfig

  // Update payment config
  public function updateConfig(int $environmentId, array $data): EnvironmentPaymentConfig

  // Enable centralized payments
  public function enableCentralizedPayments(int $environmentId): bool

  // Disable centralized payments
  public function disableCentralizedPayments(int $environmentId): bool

  // Check if environment uses centralized gateways
  public function isCentralized(int $environmentId): bool

  // Get default config values
  public function getDefaultConfig(): array
  ```

**FR2: Modify PaymentService for Centralized Routing**
- File: `app/Services/PaymentService.php`
- Modify `initializeGateway()` method:
  ```php
  protected function initializeGateway(int $environmentId, string $gateway = null)
  {
      // NEW: Check if environment uses centralized gateways
      if ($this->environmentPaymentConfigService->isCentralized($environmentId)) {
          // Fetch Environment 1's gateway settings
          $gatewaySettings = PaymentGatewaySetting::where('environment_id', 1)
              ->where('is_active', true)
              ->first();

          Log::info('Using centralized gateway for environment', [
              'environment_id' => $environmentId,
              'gateway' => $gatewaySettings->gateway_code ?? 'unknown'
          ]);
      } else {
          // EXISTING: Use environment's own gateway (backward compatible)
          $gatewaySettings = PaymentGatewaySetting::where('environment_id', $environmentId)
              ->where('is_active', true)
              ->first();
      }

      // Rest of existing initialization logic...
  }
  ```

**FR3: Add Fallback Handling**
- If Environment 1 gateway initialization fails, fall back to environment-specific gateway
- Log warning when fallback occurs
- Send alert to admin (Sentry/logging)
- Continue transaction processing with fallback

**FR4: Add Caching**
- Cache `EnvironmentPaymentConfig` records in Redis
- Cache key: `env_payment_config:{environment_id}`
- TTL: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- Cache invalidation on config update

### Integration Requirements

**IR1: Inject EnvironmentPaymentConfigService into PaymentService**
- Update `PaymentService` constructor:
  ```php
  public function __construct(
      CommissionService $commissionService,
      TaxZoneService $taxZoneService,
      EnvironmentPaymentConfigService $environmentPaymentConfigService // NEW
  ) {
      $this->commissionService = $commissionService;
      $this->taxZoneService = $taxZoneService;
      $this->environmentPaymentConfigService = $environmentPaymentConfigService; // NEW
  }
  ```

**IR2: Existing Payment Flow Unchanged**
- When `use_centralized_gateways` = false, use existing environment gateway
- All existing payment methods continue working
- No changes to transaction creation logic
- No changes to callback handling

**IR3: Audit Logging**
- Log when centralized gateway is used:
  ```php
  Log::info('Centralized gateway used', [
      'environment_id' => $environmentId,
      'transaction_id' => $transaction->id,
      'gateway' => $gatewaySettings->gateway_code
  ]);
  ```
- Log when fallback to environment gateway occurs
- Log when config changes (enable/disable centralization)

### Quality Requirements

**QR1: Service Tests**
- Unit tests for `EnvironmentPaymentConfigService`:
  - Test `getConfig()` returns correct config
  - Test `getConfig()` returns null for non-existent environment
  - Test `updateConfig()` updates database
  - Test `enableCentralizedPayments()` sets flag to true
  - Test `disableCentralizedPayments()` sets flag to false
  - Test `isCentralized()` returns correct boolean
  - Test caching works correctly
  - Test cache invalidation on update

**QR2: Integration Tests**
- Test payment flow with centralized gateway:
  - Environment opts in → uses Environment 1 gateway
  - Environment opts out → uses own gateway
  - Environment 1 always uses own gateway
- Test fallback behavior:
  - Environment 1 gateway fails → falls back to environment gateway
  - Fallback logged correctly
- Test existing payment flow still works (regression test)

**QR3: Performance Tests**
- Gateway initialization < 50ms overhead
- Config caching reduces database queries
- No N+1 query issues

## Technical Notes

### Integration Approach
- **Non-breaking modification:** Add conditional logic to existing method
- **Dependency injection:** Use constructor injection for new service
- **Caching strategy:** Redis cache with 1-hour TTL
- **Fallback pattern:** Try centralized → fallback to environment → fail gracefully

### Existing Pattern Reference
- Follow existing `CommissionService` structure
- Use existing `PaymentService` error handling patterns
- Follow existing logging conventions

### Key Constraints
- Must not break existing payment flow
- Must handle Environment 1 gateway failures gracefully
- Must log all centralized payment attempts for auditing

---

## Risk and Compatibility Check

### Primary Risk
**Payment Flow Disruption for Opted-In Environments**
- **Mitigation:**
  - Fallback to environment gateway if Environment 1 gateway fails
  - Feature flag per environment (opt-in only)
  - Extensive testing before enabling for any environment
  - Monitor first 100 centralized transactions manually

### Rollback Plan
- Admin sets `use_centralized_gateways = false` via database or admin UI
- Payment flow immediately reverts to environment gateway
- No code deployment needed for rollback

### Compatibility Verification
- [x] No breaking changes to `PaymentService` public methods
- [x] Existing payment flow works when centralized = false
- [x] Gateway factory pattern unchanged
- [x] Transaction creation logic unchanged
