## Completed Deliverables

### 1. Database Migrations (4 files)

✅ **`2025_10_08_121654_create_environment_payment_configs_table.php`**
- Table: `environment_payment_configs`
- Fields: 10 columns including `use_centralized_gateways`, `commission_rate`, `payment_terms`, `withdrawal_method`, `withdrawal_details` (JSON), `minimum_withdrawal_amount`
- Constraints: Unique FK on `environment_id`, cascading delete
- Status: **Migrated successfully**

✅ **`2025_10_08_121725_create_instructor_commissions_table.php`**
- Table: `instructor_commissions`
- Fields: 14 columns including `gross_amount`, `commission_rate`, `commission_amount`, `net_amount`, `status` (enum), `paid_at`, `payment_reference`
- Constraints: FKs to `environments`, `transactions`, `orders`
- Indexes: Composite index on `(environment_id, status)`, plus 4 additional indexes
- Status: **Migrated successfully**

✅ **`2025_10_08_121757_create_withdrawal_requests_table.php`**
- Table: `withdrawal_requests`
- Fields: 16 columns including `amount`, `status` (enum), `withdrawal_method` (enum), `withdrawal_details` (JSON), `commission_ids` (JSON), approval/processing tracking fields
- Constraints: FKs to `environments`, `users` (requested_by, approved_by, processed_by)
- Indexes: Composite index on `(environment_id, status)`, plus 3 additional indexes
- Status: **Migrated successfully**

✅ **`2025_10_08_121829_add_withdrawal_request_foreign_key_to_instructor_commissions.php`**
- Purpose: Adds FK constraint from `instructor_commissions.withdrawal_request_id` to `withdrawal_requests.id`
- Reason: Avoids circular dependency during initial migration
- Status: **Migrated successfully**

### 2. Eloquent Models (3 files)

✅ **`app/Models/EnvironmentPaymentConfig.php`**
- Mass assignable: 8 fields
- Casts: `use_centralized_gateways` (boolean), `is_active` (boolean), `commission_rate` (decimal:4), `minimum_withdrawal_amount` (decimal:2), `withdrawal_details` (array)
- Relationships:
  - `belongsTo(Environment::class)`
  - `hasMany(WithdrawalRequest::class)`
- PHPDoc: ✅ Complete

✅ **`app/Models/InstructorCommission.php`**
- Mass assignable: 13 fields
- Casts: `gross_amount`, `commission_amount`, `net_amount` (decimal:2), `commission_rate` (decimal:4), `paid_at` (datetime)
- Relationships:
  - `belongsTo(Environment::class)`
  - `belongsTo(Transaction::class)`
  - `belongsTo(Order::class)`
  - `belongsTo(WithdrawalRequest::class)`
- PHPDoc: ✅ Complete

✅ **`app/Models/WithdrawalRequest.php`**
- Mass assignable: 15 fields
- Casts: `amount` (decimal:2), `withdrawal_details` (array), `commission_ids` (array), `approved_at` (datetime), `processed_at` (datetime)
- Relationships:
  - `belongsTo(Environment::class)`
  - `belongsTo(User::class, 'requested_by')`
  - `belongsTo(User::class, 'approved_by')`
  - `belongsTo(User::class, 'processed_by')`
  - `hasMany(InstructorCommission::class)`
- PHPDoc: ✅ Complete

### 3. Updated Existing Models (3 files)

✅ **`app/Models/Environment.php`**
- Added relationships:
  - `hasOne(EnvironmentPaymentConfig::class)` - Payment configuration
  - `hasMany(InstructorCommission::class)` - Commission records
  - `hasMany(WithdrawalRequest::class)` - Withdrawal requests

✅ **`app/Models/Transaction.php`**
- Added relationship:
  - `hasOne(InstructorCommission::class)` - Associated commission

✅ **`app/Models/Order.php`**
- Added relationship:
  - `hasOne(InstructorCommission::class)` - Associated commission

### 4. Database Seeder

✅ **`database/seeders/EnvironmentPaymentConfigSeeder.php`**
- Seeds default `EnvironmentPaymentConfig` for all existing environments
- Default values:
  - `use_centralized_gateways` = false
  - `commission_rate` = 0.170 (17%)
  - `payment_terms` = 'NET_30'
  - `minimum_withdrawal_amount` = 50000.00
  - `is_active` = true
- Status: **Seeded 6 environments successfully**
  - CSL (ID: 1)
  - Individual Environment (ID: 2)
  - Okenly Learning (ID: 3)
  - WakaRoad (ID: 4)
  - InDigit (ID: 5)
  - Company Environment (ID: 6)

### 5. Model Factories (3 files)

✅ **`database/factories/EnvironmentPaymentConfigFactory.php`**
- Generates realistic test data for payment configurations
- Randomizes: `payment_terms`, `withdrawal_method`, `withdrawal_details`, `minimum_withdrawal_amount`
- Respects FK constraints

✅ **`database/factories/InstructorCommissionFactory.php`**
- Generates realistic commission records with calculated amounts
- Logic: `net_amount` = `gross_amount` - (`gross_amount` × `commission_rate`)
- Randomizes: `status`, `paid_at`, `payment_reference`, `notes`
- Respects FK constraints

✅ **`database/factories/WithdrawalRequestFactory.php`**
- Generates realistic withdrawal requests with method-specific details
- Supports: `bank_transfer`, `paypal`, `mobile_money`
- Dynamic `withdrawal_details` based on method
- Respects FK constraints

## Migration & Rollback Verification

### Migration Test 1 (Initial)
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
**Result:** ✅ All 4 migrations executed successfully (total ~4.5 seconds)

### Rollback Test
```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=4
```
**Result:** ✅ All tables dropped in correct order (FK constraint migration rolled back first)

### Migration Test 2 (Re-migration)
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
**Result:** ✅ All 4 migrations re-executed successfully

### Seeder Test
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=EnvironmentPaymentConfigSeeder
```
**Result:** ✅ 6 payment configs created (one per environment)

---

## Database Schema Created

### Tables
1. `environment_payment_configs` (10 columns, 1 unique index)
2. `instructor_commissions` (14 columns, 5 indexes)
3. `withdrawal_requests` (16 columns, 4 indexes)

### Foreign Keys
- `environment_payment_configs.environment_id` → `environments.id` (CASCADE)
- `instructor_commissions.environment_id` → `environments.id` (CASCADE)
- `instructor_commissions.transaction_id` → `transactions.id` (SET NULL)
- `instructor_commissions.order_id` → `orders.id` (SET NULL)
- `instructor_commissions.withdrawal_request_id` → `withdrawal_requests.id` (SET NULL)
- `withdrawal_requests.environment_id` → `environments.id` (CASCADE)
- `withdrawal_requests.requested_by` → `users.id` (CASCADE)
- `withdrawal_requests.approved_by` → `users.id` (SET NULL)
- `withdrawal_requests.processed_by` → `users.id` (SET NULL)

### Indexes
- Composite: `(environment_id, status)` on both `instructor_commissions` and `withdrawal_requests`
- Single: `transaction_id`, `order_id`, `status`, `created_at`, `requested_by`

## Code Quality

✅ **PSR-12 Compliance:** All PHP code follows PSR-12 coding standards
✅ **PHPDoc Comments:** All models have complete PHPDoc comments
✅ **Naming Conventions:** Laravel conventions followed throughout
✅ **Type Hints:** Return type hints used for all relationship methods
✅ **Mass Assignment Protection:** `$fillable` arrays defined for all models
✅ **Data Casting:** Proper casts defined for JSON, boolean, decimal, datetime fields

## Pending Tasks (Next Steps)

### Story 1 Remaining Work
1. **Unit Tests** (Estimated: 4 hours)
   - Model relationship tests (15 tests)
   - Foreign key constraint tests
   - Cascading delete tests
   - Unique constraint tests

2. **PHPStan Analysis** (Estimated: 1 hour)
   - Run PHPStan level 8 analysis
   - Fix any type errors

3. **Documentation** (Estimated: 2 hours)
   - Create database schema diagram (Mermaid or dbdiagram.io)
   - Update README.md with new models
   - Document model relationships

### Story 2 Prerequisites
Story 2 (Environment Payment Config Service & Centralized Gateway Routing) can now proceed as all database foundation is complete.

## Known Issues / Decisions

### Decision: Separate FK Constraint Migration
- **Issue:** Circular dependency (`instructor_commissions` references `withdrawal_requests`, but `withdrawal_requests` depends on `instructor_commissions` existing)
- **Solution:** Created 4th migration (`add_withdrawal_request_foreign_key_to_instructor_commissions`) to add FK constraint after both tables exist
- **Impact:** None - rollback works correctly, no data loss

### Design Choice: Nullable Transaction/Order IDs
- `instructor_commissions.transaction_id` and `order_id` are nullable with `ON DELETE SET NULL`
- Allows historical commission records to persist even if transactions/orders are soft-deleted
- Maintains data integrity for accounting purposes
