## Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing

### Security Testing
- [ ] All API calls include authentication token
- [ ] Only super_admin role can access pages

## Known Limitations

1. **No Real-time Updates**: Data refreshes only on user action or page load (no WebSockets)
2. **No Advanced Filtering**: Environment filter not yet implemented (can be added)
3. **No Sorting**: Tables don't support column sorting (can be added)
4. **CSV Export**: Client-side download only (no server-side streaming for large datasets)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add Environment Filter** to transactions and commissions pages
2. **Column Sorting** for all tables
3. **Advanced Search** with transaction ID, amount range
4. **Real-time Notifications** for new withdrawal requests
5. **Bulk Rejection** for withdrawal requests
6. **Audit Log** showing who approved/rejected what and when
7. **PDF Export** for withdrawal statements
8. **Charts/Graphs** for transaction trends
9. **Batch Processing** for multiple approved withdrawals

## Acceptance Criteria Met
