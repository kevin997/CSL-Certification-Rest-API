## 20.3 Known Gaps & Future Work

**Documentation Gaps:**
- Detailed API authentication flow diagrams (planned for next update)
- Serverless functions architecture (CSL-Serverless-Functions not fully explored)
- Mobile app architecture (if applicable)

**Technical Debt:**
- Some payment gateways partially implemented (FlutterWave, CinetPay)
- Queue job monitoring dashboard needed
- Automated backup strategy documentation needed

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this document with development team
2. Update based on feedback
3. Create sharded architecture docs (per-domain breakdown)
4. Generate API documentation from OpenAPI specs
5. Create visual architecture posters for team reference
